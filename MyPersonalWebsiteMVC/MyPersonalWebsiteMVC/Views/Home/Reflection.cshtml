<h2>Personal Reflection</h2>

<p>
    Working on this MVC application helped me better understand how web
    applications are structured using the Model-View-Controller pattern.
    Separating concerns between controllers, models, and views made the
    application easier to organize and expand.
</p>

<p>
    I also gained a deeper appreciation for front-end development, particularly
    how Razor syntax allows C# logic to blend naturally with HTML. Even without
    backend processing, designing forms and layouts highlighted the importance
    of user experience and interface clarity.
</p>

<p>
    This project strengthened my interest in application development and
    reinforced my motivation to continue learning modern technologies that
    evolve alongside user needs.
