<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>
    I am currently a Computer Science student who is continuously learning and
    adapting to new technologies. What initially drew me to this field was the
    curiosity of understanding how everyday digital tools function internally.
</p>

<p>
    As technology continues to evolve at a rapid pace, I find motivation in
    keeping up with these changes and understanding how software solutions are
    designed to solve real-world problems.

<p>
    This application serves as a front-end focused project that reflects both
    my technical learning and my personal journey in Computer Science.
